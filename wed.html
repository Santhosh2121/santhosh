                                    <p>FromSoftware wanted to create an
									open-world game based on Dark Souls.
									Miyazaki admired Martin's previous work
									and hoped that his contributions would 
									produce a more accessible narrative than
									those of the company's earlier games.</P> 
									<p> Martinwas given unrestricted freedom to 
									design thebackstory, while Miyazaki was lead 
									writer forthe in-game narrative. However, 
									the game's narrative is still presented through
									flavortext, dialogue, visual narrative, and 
									players' interpretations. The developers
									concentrated on environmental scale, stat
									management, and the story; the scale required
									the construction of several structures around 
									its world </p>  </section>

                     <p>Elden Ring is an action role-playing game set in third-person
					 perspective. It includes elements that are similar to
					 those in other FromSoftware-developed games, such as 
					 the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows
					 Die Twice. The game is set in an open world; players
					 can freely explore the Lands Between and its six main
					 areas, which include Limgrave—an area of grassy plains
					 and ancient ruins—and Caelid, a reddish wasteland home 
					 to undead monsters.</p><p>[1] The open world is explored using
					 the character's mount Torrent as the main mode of 
					 transportation, though players may use fast travel
					 outside combat. Throughout the game, players encounter
					 non-player characters (NPCs) and enemies, including demigods
					 who rule each main area and serve as the game's main bosses
					 [2][3] Aside from the main areas, Elden Ring has hidden 
					 dungeons, catacombs, tunnels, and caves where players can 
					 fight bosses and gather helpful items.[4]</p>
